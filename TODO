Suggestions:

-:LIBFILTER_DROP - like other lib filters, but these libs would
not be linked in at all.

CFLAGS filters: for dropping problematic flags

Add a collection of Makefile.am androgenizer templates, so we
don't forget to include all the automake default variables.

Get rid of absolute paths in output, so that generated Android.mk
files can be distributed.

Add the ability to install files as is, for example something like this:
-:COPY_FILES_TO <target dir>	starts a new multi-module
-:SOURCES <files>		the list of files to be copied
-:TAGS <tags>			as usual
LOCAL_MODULE_CLASS would probably be hardcoded to "ETC".
How to deal with directories? Should the directory prefixes in <files> be
preserved in the installation and to what depth? cwd? top_dir?
Do we need to easily copy whole sub-trees?
